# IoT-enabled-Biometric-eLock
This is a project of my internship programme .The main statement of this project is to develop a secure locking system based on fingerprint scanning which operate wirelessly. In this project, we have used Wi-Fi inbuilt NodeMCU which helps us to control our lock from distant. Apart from opening and controlling of the lock, we have also given two modes--Admin Mode and User Mode which is controlled from a web browser which makes it more users friendly and interactive.
